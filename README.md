# Book-Recommender-System
The objective here is to create a website of books where we can recommend 5  more books based on the book choosen by the user. Its basically a mixture of popularity based recommender system and collaborative filtering based recommender system. If a new user visits the website we can show him the top 50 highest rated books from which he can choose.
